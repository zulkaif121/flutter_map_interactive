/// Lightweight `Map` widget for flutter supporting different projections including EPSG4326/Mercator/WGS1984.
///
/// * Written entirely in Dart. No plugins, No platform code, No native code.
///
/// * Map is vendor-free. Meaning that you can choose any tile provider of your choice. Google Maps, Mapbox, OSM Maps and Yandex Maps are a few to name. You can also use this package with your own custom tiles, your own server, your own [sub]domain.
///
/// * Support for vector tiles is under development in [vt](https://pub.dev/packages/vt) and [cartography](https://pub.dev/packages/cartography) packages. Please checkout these packages to know more about the progress and open issues/tasks.
///
/// * This package supports **caching** out of the box through [cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) and [flutter_cache_manager](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_cache_manager) packages.
