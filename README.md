Lightweight and powerful geographical `Map` widget for Flutter, supporting different layers and projections including EPSG4326/Mercator/WGS1984.

* Written entirely in Dart. No plugins, No platform code, No native code.

* Map is vendor-free. Meaning that you can choose any tile provider of your choice. Google Maps, Mapbox, OSM Maps and Yandex Maps are a few to name. You can also use this package with your own custom tiles, your own server, your own [sub]domain.

* Support for vector tiles is under development in [vt](https://pub.dev/packages/vt) and [cartography](https://pub.dev/packages/cartography) packages. Please checkout these packages to know more about the progress and open issues/tasks.

* This package supports **caching** out of the box through [cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) and [flutter_cache_manager](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_cache_manager) packages.

## Getting Started

In your `pubspec.yaml` file add:

```dart
dependencies:
  map: any
```

Then, in your code import:

```dart
import 'package:map/map.dart';
```

```dart
final controller = MapController(
  location: const LatLng(Angle.degree(Angle.degree(0)), Angle.degree(Angle.degree(0))),
  zoom: 2,
);
```

```dart
MapLayout(
  controller: controller,
  builder: (context, transformer) {
    return TileLayer(
      builder: (context, x, y, z) {
        final tilesInZoom = pow(2.0, z).floor();

        while (x < 0) {
          x += tilesInZoom;
        }
        while (y < 0) {
          y += tilesInZoom;
        }

        x %= tilesInZoom;
        y %= tilesInZoom;

        //Google Maps
        final url =
            'https://www.google.com/maps/vt/pb=!1m4!1m3!1i$z!2i$x!3i$y!2m3!1e0!2sm!3i420120488!3m7!2sen!5e1105!12m4!1e68!2m2!1sset!2sRoadmap!4e0!5m1!1e0!23i4111425';

        return CachedNetworkImage(
          imageUrl: url,
          fit: BoxFit.cover,
        );
      },
    );
  },
);
```
